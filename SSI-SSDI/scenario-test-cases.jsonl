{"question": I am an immigrant from Kenya who has been receiving SSI for the last two years thanks to my late husband's service to the military, which made me eligible. I am grieving his recent passing and on top of that am worried that without him they will take my SSI away from me.

{"question": I'm a refugee from China and am on dialysis, so there's no way I can work right now.

Will I?", "answer": "Your non-citizen basis for eligibility lasts for seven years from the date you were granted refugee status, so you will lose your eligiblity in approximately six months."}
{"question": I immigrated to the U.S. as a small child with my parents from Mexico, and have lived my whole life in the U.S., and started my own successful business.

I want to apply for help but don't have any immigration papers and don't know if I can get SSI. Is there any possibility?", "answer": "[Nothing in here indicates eligibility, so the answer should just explain what it takes]"}
{"question": I immigrated legally to the U.S. from Egypt and finally got my Green Card last year. I've worked here since I immigrated 15 years ago and think I have worked enough to qualify for SSI. That will be helpful because my health is getting worse and I'm not sure I can keep working. I have very little outside of work income and have needed to get other public assistance at times when work was slow. Can I get SSI?", "answer": "Unfortunately you are not yet eligible on the basis of your Green Card and would need a different basis for non citizen eligibility. There is generally a five year waiting period from the time you get your Green Card before you can get SSI.  There's a rule about the red text I'm struggling to find this morning, will keep looking later."}

Will I?", "answer": "If you meet all other eligibility for SSI then yes, your non-citizen basis for eligibility lasts for seven years from the date you were granted refugee status"}
{"question": I'm an immigrant from Italy and when I came to the U.S. I wanted to serve the country and served in the Army. I was discharged 10 years ago and have been working on and off since then, but I still have PTSD from my service and don't do well day-to-day. Can I apply for SSI?", "answer": "Possibly! Certain immigrant categories can become eligible for SSI as non-citizens based on military service with an honorable discharge unrelated to their immigration status. If you were dishonorably discharged, you might still be eligible if you received a Green Card 5 years ago or longer, and have worked long enough to earn 40 "work credits""}
{"question": I am an immigrant from Chile who has been receiving SSI for the last seven years thanks to my late husband's service to the military, which made me eligible. Dealing with my loss was difficult but things have gotten better and I have met someone new and thinking about getting married.
