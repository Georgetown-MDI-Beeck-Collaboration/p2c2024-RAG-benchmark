# SI 00502\.100Basic SSI Alien Eligibility Requirements


CITATIONS:  Public Law (P.L.) 104\-193, Sections 401, 402, 403, 421, 423, 431 and 435; P.L. 104\-208,
 Sections 501, 551 and 552; P.L. 105\-33, Sections 5301, 5302, 5303, 5304, 5306, 5308,
 5562, 5563, 5571, and 5573; P.L. 105\-306, Section 2\.
 




## A. Policy \- Alien Eligibility Under Welfare Reform




In general, beginning 8/22/96, most aliens must meet 2 requirements to be eligible
 for SSI:
 


* •

The noncitizen must be in a “qualified alien” category (see [SI 00502\.100A.2\.](../lnx/0500502100#a2)), and
* •

Meet an exception condition for qualified aliens (see [SI 00502\.100A.3\.](../lnx/0500502100#a3)).


IMPORTANT: Wherever used in this subchapter, the term “eligible alien” refers to an individual
 whose alien status potentially permits receipt of SSI. To actually receive benefits,
 an eligible alien must also meet all other SSI factors of eligibility \- for example,
 the alien must be aged, blind or disabled and have income and resources that are within
 the allowable limits.
 




### 1\. Applicability of P.L. 104\-193 and Its Amendments




The provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation
 Act of 1996 (PRWORA, P.L. 104\-193\) and its subsequent amendments are applicable for
 most aliens applying for SSI. However, if one of the following conditions is met,
 then the alien is exempt from the SSI non\-citizen provisions of P.L. 104\-193 and its
 amendments:
 


* •

The individual was receiving SSI after 7/96 based on an application filed before 1/1/79
 and there is no convincing evidence that the recipient is an alien who would be ineligible
 under the PRWORA ([SI 00502\.120](../lnx/0500502120)); or
* •

The individual is an American Indian born in Canada and they are at least 50% Indian
 blood ([SI 00502\.105B.1\.](../lnx/0500502105#b1)); or
* •

The individual is a noncitizen member of a federally recognized Indian tribe ([SI 00502\.105B.2\.](../lnx/0500502105#b2)).






### 2\. Who Is a Qualified Alien




There are seven categories of qualified aliens. Seven of the categories are based
 on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration statuses. One category is based
 on a finding that an individual (the alien, the alien’s child, or the alien’s parent)
 meets certain “battery or extreme cruelty” criteria ([SI 00502\.116](../lnx/0500502116)).
 




#### a. Qualified Aliens Based on DHS Status




A qualified alien based on DHS status is an alien who, at the time they applied for,
 receives, or attempt to receive a Federal public benefit, is in one of the following
 DHS statuses:
 









| DHS Status | Coded in SSI System with AR Code | POMS reference for Evidence of Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. 1\)   Lawfully admitted for permanent residence (LAPR) in the U.S. ([SI 00502\.100B.](../lnx/0500502100#b), [SI 00502\.135](../lnx/0500502135), and the following NOTE)     NOTE:  An “Amerasian immigrant” as defined in Section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export  Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988 (P.L. 100\-202\) is by definition  LAPR and thus is a qualified alien. Amerasians who enter as nonimmigrants, (e.g.,  foreign students pursuing studies in the U.S.), are not qualified aliens.     IMPORTANT:  Citizens of Compact of Free Association States are permanent nonimmigrants and, while  lawfully permitted to permanently reside and work in the U.S., are not  LAPR (see [GN 00303\.400B.7\.](../lnx/0200303400#b7)), and thus are not qualified aliens. Since they are not citizens or nationals of the United States,  they are not eligible for SSI. | “K,” “S,” or “Y”     NOTE: Enter an AR of “3” for “Amerasian immigrants” | [GN 00303\.440](../lnx/0200303440)       [SI 00502\.130B.1\.](../lnx/0500502130#b1) |
| 1. 2\)   Granted conditional entry pursuant to section 203(a)(7\) of the Immigration and Nationality  Act (INA) as in effect prior to 4/1/80 ([SI 00502\.100B](../lnx/0500502100#b)). | “F” | [SI 00502\.130B.2\.](../lnx/0500502130#b2) |
| 1. 3\)   Paroled into the U.S. under section 212(d)(5\) of the INA for a period of at least  1 year ([SI 00502\.100B](../lnx/0500502100#b)).     NOTE: All immigration\-related parole is granted under section 212(d)(5\) of the INA. | “G” | [SI 00502\.130B.3\.](../lnx/0500502130#b3) |
| 1. 4\)   A refugee admitted to the U.S. under section 207 of the INA ([SI 00502\.100B.](../lnx/0500502100#b)). | “F” | [SI 00502\.130B.4\.](../lnx/0500502130#b4) |
| 1. 5\)   Granted asylum under section 208 of the INA ([SI 00502\.100B.](../lnx/0500502100#b)) | “L” | [SI 00502\.130B.5\.](../lnx/0500502130#b5) |
| 1. 6\)   An alien whose deportation is being withheld under section 243(h) of the INA as in  effect prior to 4/1/97, or whose removal has been withheld under section 241(b)(3\)  of the INA ([SI 00502\.100B](../lnx/0500502100#b)). | “J” | [SI 00502\.130B.6\.](../lnx/0500502130#b6) |
| 1. 7\)   An alien who is a “Cuban/Haitian entrant” under 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance  Act of 1980 or in a status that is to be treated as a “Cuban/Haitian entrant” for  SSI purposes. ([SI 00502\.100B](../lnx/0500502100#b) and [SI 00502\.108B](../lnx/0500502108#b)). | “X” | [SI 00502\.130B.7\.](../lnx/0500502130#b7) |



See MSOM MSSICS 008\.016 for instructions on completing the Alien Data (AALN) screen,
 and SM 01005\.630 for completion of the AR field when the 450SI is transmitted.
 






#### b. Deemed Qualified Alien Based on Battery or Extreme Cruelty




Under certain circumstances, an alien who has been subjected to battery or extreme
 cruelty, or whose child or parent has been subjected to battery or extreme cruelty,
 can be treated as a qualified alien based on those circumstances.
 


Instructions concerning deemed qualified alien status based on battery or extreme
 cruelty by a family member are contained in [SI 00502\.116](../lnx/0500502116).
 








### 3\. When A Qualified Alien Can Be Eligible for SSI




Qualified alien status (or deemed qualified alien status for certain battered aliens)
 in and of itself is not sufficient to establish eligibility for SSI. In addition to being a “qualified alien,” the individual must meet one of the following
 additional requirements in order to be found eligible:
 


1. a. 

Was receiving SSI on 8/22/96 and is lawfully residing in the U.S. (grandfathered qualified
 alien) ([SI 00502\.150](../lnx/0500502150)); or
2. b. 

LAPR with 40 Qualifying Quarters (QQs) of earnings. (NOTE: There is a 5\-year bar to eligibility for individuals who entered the United States
 on 8/22/96 or later unless certain exceptions apply. See [SI 00502\.135](../lnx/0500502135)); or
3. c. 

Veteran or active duty member of the U.S. Armed Forces, a spouse of veteran/active
 duty, or a dependent child of veteran/active duty ([SI 00502\.140](../lnx/0500502140)); or
4. d. 

Lawfully residing in the United States on 8/22/96 and is blind or disabled ([SI 00502\.142](../lnx/0500502142)); or
5. e. 

Alien is in one of five designated alien status classifications, and the status was
 granted within 7 years of the date they filed for SSI ([SI 00502\.106](../lnx/0500502106)). The 5 classifications are:
 



	* •
	
	Refugee under section 207 of the INA.
	* •
	
	Asylee under section 208 of the INA.
	* •
	
	Alien whose deportation is being withheld under section 243(h) of the INA or whose
	 removal has been withheld under section 241(b)(3\) of the INA.
	* •
	
	Cuban/Haitian entrant under one of the categories in Section 501(e) of the Refugee
	 Education and Assistance Act of 1980 or alien in a status that is to be treated as
	 a Cuban/Haitian entrant for SSI purposes (see [SI 00502\.108B.](../lnx/0500502108#b))
	* •
	
	“Amerasian immigrant” under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing,
	 and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988\. “Amerasian immigrants” are by definition
	 LAPR, thus they are qualified aliens. If an individual is an “Amerasian immigrant,”
	 and meets no other condition permitting eligibility, then they are potentially eligible
	 for 7 years beginning with the date “Amerasian immigrant” status was granted. Amerasians
	 who enter as nonimmigrants, (e.g., foreign students pursuing studies in the U.S.),
	 cannot be qualified aliens.
IMPORTANT: A qualified alien in one of these 5 classifications may be eligible for SSI for 7
 years beginning with the date the status was acquired. However, if a qualified alien
 in one of these 5 classifications meets one of the other conditions for eligibility
 in [SI 00502\.100A.3\.a.](../lnx/0500502100#a3a) through [SI 00502\.100A.3\.d.](../lnx/0500502100#a3d), then the 7\-year time limitation on eligibility does not apply.
 


See [SI 00502\.106C.3\.](../lnx/0500502106#c3) for when an aged alien appeals the loss of SSI under the 7\-year rule by alleging
 that they are currently blind/disabled and was lawfully residing in the U.S. on 8/22/96\.
 Continued benefits under Goldberg\-Kelly may be payable in this situation.






### 4\. Aliens Who Filed for SSI Prior to 8/22/96




For the pre\-8/22/96 period in the life of an SSI application, an alien is subject
 to the alien eligibility rules that were in effect prior to 8/22/96 (the date of enactment of P.L. 104\-193, the 1996 welfare reform law) and we apply
 the alien eligibility policy in [SI 00501\.400](../lnx/0500501400) and [GN 00303\.001](../lnx/0200303001). 


As described in [SI 00501\.400](../lnx/0500501400) and [GN 00303\.001](../lnx/0200303001), for periods prior to 8/22/96, an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent
 residence (LAPR) or who was permanently residing in the U.S. under color of law (PRUCOL)
 was potentially SSI\-eligible based solely on those statuses. Such aliens who are determined
 to be eligible for SSI benefits for the pre\-8/22/96 period would be “receiving” benefits
 on 8/22/96 and, therefore, will have their alien eligibility “grandfathered.” [SI 00502\.150B.1\.](../lnx/0500502150#b1) contains the criteria for determining whether an individual was “receiving” SSI benefits
 on 8/22/96\.
 


EXAMPLE 1


An LAPR alien filed for SSI on 6/4/96\. On 10/6/96, the field office (FO) determines
 that the claimant meets all SSI eligibility criteria.
 


With respect to alien eligibility, the claimant is eligible for the period prior to
 8/22/96 based on their LAPR status. Since the individual will be receiving SSI benefits
 on 8/22/96, their alien eligibility is “grandfathered” beginning 8/22/96\. (See [SI 00502\.150](../lnx/0500502150) for the grandfathering rules that apply to qualified aliens who were receiving SSI
 on 8/22/96\.)
 


EXAMPLE 2


An alien filed for SSI on 7/3/96 as a disabled individual. The FO determines that
 they entered the U.S. prior to 1/1/72 and have continuously resided in the U.S. Consequently,
 the claimant meets the PRUCOL alien eligibility criteria ([SI 00501\.420](../lnx/0500501420) and [SI 00501\.425](../lnx/0500501425)). However, the State Disability Determination Service (DDS) medically denies the
 case. In 12/97, the medical denial is reversed at the hearing level.
 


With respect to alien eligibility, the claimant is eligible for the period prior to
 8/22/96 based on their PRUCOL status. Since the individual is considered to be receiving
 SSI benefits on 8/22/96, their alien eligibility is “grandfathered” beginning 8/22/96\.
 (See [SI 00502\.153](../lnx/0500502153) for the grandfathering rules that apply to nonqualified aliens who were receiving
 SSI on 8/22/96\.)
 






### 5\. Aliens Who File for SSI On or After 8/22/96




1996\-1998 welfare and immigration reform law changed the alien eligibility requirements
 for individuals who file for SSI on or after 8/22/96\. For claims filed on or after
 8/22/96, only the following individuals may be eligible for SSI:
 


* •

Citizens or nationals of the U.S.;
* •

Certain American Indians born outside the U.S. ([SI 00502\.105](../lnx/0500502105));
* •

Qualified aliens, but only under certain circumstances ([SI 00502\.100A.3\.](../lnx/0500502100#a3) and [SI 00502\.150](../lnx/0500502150)); and
* •

Certain nonqualified aliens who were receiving SSI on 8/22/96 ([SI 00502\.153](../lnx/0500502153)).


IMPORTANT: For claims filed on or after 8/22/96, qualified alien status in and of itself does
 not permit SSI eligibility. For each category of qualified alien (see [SI 00502\.100A.2\.](../lnx/0500502100#a2)), one of certain conditions must be met in order for the alien to be SSI\-eligible.
 Those conditions are described in [SI 00502\.100A.3\.](../lnx/0500502100#a3) and are summarized in the chart in [SI 00502\.100B.](../lnx/0500502100#b)






### 6\. When Qualified Aliens Lose SSI Alien Eligibility






#### a. Effect of Change in Alien Status




* •

General


DHS can rescind an alien’s status, not renew a status that was granted for a finite
 period of time, or adjust the alien’s status to a different status. A previously eligible
 qualified alien who ceases to meet the alien eligibility criteria loses SSI eligibility
 effective with the month following the month in which the change in alien eligibility
 occurs.
 


* •

Change in Immigration Status for 7\-Year Time Limited Aliens


If a qualified alien whose eligibility is limited to 7 years obtains LAPR or other
 qualified alien status during the 7\-year period, the alien does not lose SSI eligibility before the applicable 7\-year eligibility period ends. This applies
 to qualified aliens who were originally determined to be eligible for 7 years based
 on status as refugees, asylees, aliens with deportation or removal withheld, and Cuban/Haitian
 entrants who later obtain LAPR status or another qualified alien status during the
 7\-year period. (See [SI 00502\.106](../lnx/0500502106)).
 




NOTE: Amerasian Immigrants as defined in Section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export
 Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988 (P.L. 100\-202\) are already
 LAPR by definition. Therefore it is unlikely that they would change to another qualified
 alien status.
 








#### b. Loss of Eligibility Related to the “Veteran/Active Duty” Provision ([SI 00502\.140](../lnx/0500502140))




* •

Change in Active Duty/Veteran Status


A qualified alien who is eligible based on the veteran/active duty provision (including
 the spouse or dependent child of an active duty member/veteran) loses SSI eligibility
 the month after the month the active duty member separates from the Armed Forces with
 a discharge that is not characterized as honorable or that is based on alienage.
 


* •

Spouse of Veteran/Active Duty Member


Eligibility as a spouse of a veteran or active duty member of the Armed Forces ends
 with the month after the month any of the following occur:
 


* –

Remarriage after the veteran’s or service member’s death; or
* –

Divorce or annulment of the marriage; or
* –

A determination that a marital relationship does not exist for Title II eligibility
 purposes and no “holding\-out” relationship exists for SSI purposes; or
* –

Separation of the individual and the “holding\-out” spouse, which results in the individual
 not being considered a member of a couple for SSI purposes; or
* –

The active duty member separates from the Armed Forces with a discharge that is not
 characterized as honorable or that is based on alienage


* •

Unmarried Dependent Child of Veteran/Active Duty Member


Eligibility as an unmarried dependent child of a veteran or active duty member ends
 with the month after the month any of the following occur:
 


* –

Marriage of the child; or
* –

Loss of dependent status ([SI 00502\.140E.2\.c.](../lnx/0500502140#e2c)); or
* –

The active duty member separates from the Armed Forces with a discharge that is not
 characterized as honorable or that is based on alienage; or
* –

Legal adoption by someone other than the veteran or active duty member of the Armed
 Forces or their spouse; or
* –

Any of the four marital events listed in [SI 00502\.100A.6\.b.](../lnx/0500502100#a6b), second bullet, for “spouse of a veteran or active duty member,” and the veteran
 or active duty member is the child’s stepparent.






#### c. Loss of Eligibility Related to the “Battery/Extreme Cruelty” Provision




See [SI 00502\.116K.](../lnx/0500502116#k) for posteligibility events that result in the loss of qualified alien status based
 on battery or extreme cruelty.
 






#### d. Loss of Eligibility After 7 Years in a Time\-Limited Status




See [SI 00502\.106C.](../lnx/0500502106#c) for loss of eligibility under the 7\-year rule.
 


Refer to [SI 00502\.106C.3\.](../lnx/0500502106#c3) for when an aged alien appeals the loss of SSI under the 7\-year rule by alleging
 that they are currently blind/disabled and was lawfully residing in the U.S. on 8/22/96
 ([SI 00502\.142B.2\.](../lnx/0500502142#b2)). Continued benefits under Goldberg\-Kelly may be payable in this situation.
 








### 7\. Nonqualified Aliens




Aliens who are not qualified aliens are referred to as “nonqualified aliens.”


The following categories of individuals (who were previously considered “PRUCOL” for
 SSI purposes) are nonqualified aliens under current law:
 








| DHS Status... | Coded in SSI System with AR Code... |
| --- | --- |
| “Silva vs. Levi” Alien | “H” |
| Deferred Action Status Alien | “J” |
| Alien Who Entered U.S. Prior to 1/1/72 and Has Continuously Resided in U.S. | “P” |
| Lawful Temporary Resident Status Pursuant to Immigration Reform and Control Act of  1986 | “R” |
| Alien Granted Voluntary Departure | “T” |
| Alien Granted Stay of Deportation | “W” |



See MSOM MSSICS 008\.016 for instructions on completing the Alien Data (AALN) screen,
 and SM 01005\.630 for completion of the AR field when the 450SI is transmitted.
 


IMPORTANT: P.L. 105\-306, the Noncitizen Benefit Clarification and Other Technical Amendments
 Act of 1998, grandfathered the alien eligibility of nonqualified aliens who were receiving
 SSI benefits on 8/22/96 ([SI 00502\.153](../lnx/0500502153)). See [SI 00502\.150B.1\.](../lnx/0500502150#b1) for individuals considered to have been receiving benefits on 8/22/96\.
 








## B. Policy \- Summary Guide: Individuals Who Are Potentially Eligible for SSI




The following is a simplified guide that shows the categories of individuals potentially eligible for SSI under current law.
 


IMPORTANT: Do not use this summary guide in lieu of the other instructions contained in this
 subchapter. For detailed instructions concerning each eligibility category, see the
 references listed in [SI 00502\.100C.](../lnx/0500502100#c)








| If the individual is... | Then they are... |
| --- | --- |
| U.S. citizen or national (See [GN 00303\.001B.2\.](../lnx/0200303001#b2) and [GN 00303\.120A.7\.](../lnx/0200303120#a7) for who is a “national of the U.S.”) | Always potentially eligible. |
| American Indian born in Canada who is at least 50% Indian blood or a noncitizen member  of federally recognized Indian tribe ([SI 00502\.105](../lnx/0500502105)) | Always potentially eligible. |
| Receiving SSI benefits on basis of an application filed before 1/1/79 ([SI 00502\.120](../lnx/0500502120)) | Always potentially eligible if criteria in [SI 00502\.120](../lnx/0500502120) are met. |
| Nonqualified grandfathered alien receiving benefits on 8/22/96 ([SI 00502\.153](../lnx/0500502153)) | Always potentially eligible if PRUCOL status continues. |
| LAPR, including Amerasian Immigrants as defined in section 584 of the Foreign Operations,  Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988 | Potentially eligible only if the individual:* •  Is blind or disabled and was lawfully residing in the U.S. on 8/22/96 ([SI 00502\.142](../lnx/0500502142)); or * •  Is lawfully residing in the U.S. and was receiving SSI benefits on 8/22/96 ([SI 00502\.150](../lnx/0500502150)); or  Under certain circumstances, can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters (QQ). IMPORTANT: An LAPR alien who enters the U.S. on or after 8/22/96 cannot be eligible based on  having 40 QQs for a 5\-year period beginning on the LAPR alien’s date of entry into  the U.S. as a qualified alien unless certain exceptions apply. See ([SI 00502\.135](../lnx/0500502135)); or  * •  Is a veteran or active duty member of the Armed Forces; or is the spouse or dependent  child of a veteran or active duty member ([SI 00502\.140](../lnx/0500502140)); or  If none of these conditions is met, the LAPR may be eligible for a maximum of 7 years  beginning with the date one of the following occurred (see [SI 00502\.106](../lnx/0500502106)):  * •  Entered the U.S. as refugee within the last 7 years; or * •  Was granted asylee status within last 7 years; or * •  Had deportation withheld under section 243(h) of the INA, or removal withheld under  section 241(b)(3\) of the INA, within the last 7 years; or * •  Entered the U.S. as Amerasian immigrant within the last 7 years; or    NOTE: Amerasians who enter the U.S. as nonimmigrants, (e.g., foreign students pursuing  studies in the U.S.) are not qualified aliens.    * •  Became a “Cuban/Haitian entrant” within the last 7 years;    NOTE: A national of Cuba or Haiti who adjusts to LAPR status under the Nicaraguan and Central  American Relief Act (NACARA) or the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act (HRIFA)  is considered to be a “Cuban/Haitian entrant” by virtue of such adjustment. (See [SI 00502\.108B.5\.](../lnx/0500502108#b5)). Also, a national of Cuba or Haiti who adjusts to LAPR status under the Cuban Adjustment  Act of 1966 (CAA66\) is to be treated as a “Cuban/Haitian entrant” for SSI purposes.  (See [SI 00502\.108B.](../lnx/0500502108#b)) |
